# Used to set the target solar panel air temperature when the pump is triggered. 
# I use pool temperature (sensor.<pool_water_temp>) then add 5c (float + 5) but you could use an outside ambient air temp sensor to compare against 
# or anything that indicates the heat inside the solar panel is increasing due to the sun hitting it, which will then generate heat in the water within the pipes.
