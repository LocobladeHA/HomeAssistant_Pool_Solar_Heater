# Used to set the target solar panel air temperature when the pump is triggered. 
# I use pool temperature (sensor.<pool_water_temp>) then add 5c (float + 5) as the current pool temperature really dictates 
# how hot the panel air temp needs to be in order to add meaningful heat to the circulated water. Adjust the float value if you 
# find your panels need to be warmer or cooler to add heat to the water.
