# Add these to your sensor template yaml
# The platorm filter gives a smoothed out 2 second moving average of the returning water temperature required by the platform filter that calculates kW output2.
# The platform template calculates how much heat output in Kw the panels are generating. 
# Note you need to change the <FLOW RATE IN LITRES/MIN> value to your solar panel return flow rate in litres / minute, measure with a bucket and stopwatch :)
